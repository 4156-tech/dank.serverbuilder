# Dank.ServerBuilder.exe
A complete package for building and hosting a minecraft paper server on your windows system!

- several changes have been made since the older .cmd ( concurrent downloads | openjdk-16.msi | lesser manual work )
- src in dank.serverbuilder.py

Note: The exe might be flagged as malware, since it has been written in python. Also try to not spam the [ enter ] key on the exe, as it can cause the program to take in the wrong input. If this has occured, close the exe and relaunch it.
